Reproduction of results for two gene toggle switch as published by TS Gardner et. al., Nature, vol 403 (2000)
This code is for searching roots of two differential equations related to two mutually repressive genes. First it searches roots for
each of the equation via bisection method (similar to binary search) and then when these roots are plotted, they form nulclines
intersecting in one or three points. These points are roots of the system of two gene toggle switch.
